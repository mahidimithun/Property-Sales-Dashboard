# Property-Sales-Dashboard
I've developed this Property Management Dashboard using Power BI, incorporating advanced data visualization techniques and leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create insightful analytics.
Key features of the dashboard include:
✅ Revenue, Expense, and Income tracking.
✅ Insights by property type, sales method, and geography.
✅ Client and transaction details with payment statuses.
✅ Interactive visuals for enhanced decision-making.
